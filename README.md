## Installation

This application **requires Docker and Docker Compose**. All other setup is handled automatically by the container.
### Development (Contributors)

1. **Clone the project:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/pagyP/readingnook.git
   cd readingnook
   ```

2. **Set environment variables:**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env and set SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI and SECRET_KEY
   ```

3. **Start the application (builds from local Dockerfile):**
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

4. **Open your browser** and navigate to `http://localhost:8000`

### Production (Users)

For users who want to run the pre-built image from GitHub Container Registry:

1. **Create environment file:**
   ```bash
   # Create .env with your database configuration
   DB_USER=readingnook
   DB_PASSWORD=<change-to-secure-password>
   DB_NAME=readingnook
   SECRET_KEY=<generate-with-python>
   FLASK_ENV=production
   SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE=True
   ```

2. **Create docker-compose file:**
   ```bash
   # Copy the production compose file
   cp docker-compose.prod.yml docker-compose.yml
   ```

3. **Start the application (uses pre-built image):**
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

4. **Open your browser** and navigate to `http://localhost:8000`

**Note:** Database schema is created automatically on startup via `init_db.py`. If you're upgrading from a version created before the MFA feature, see [DOCKER_DEPLOYMENT.md](DOCKER_DEPLOYMENT.md) for schema migration instructions.

For detailed Docker and production deployment instructions, see [DOCKER_DEPLOYMENT.md](DOCKER_DEPLOYMENT.md).

## Security Features

✅ **User Authentication** - Create accounts with secure password hashing  
✅ **Password Hashing** - Passwords hashed using Argon2 (memory-hard, GPU-resistant)  
✅ **Account Recovery** - Recover lost passwords using single-use recovery codes (no email required)  
✅ **Session Management** - Secure session handling with Flask-Login and 24-hour persistent timeout  
✅ **CSRF Protection** - All forms protected with CSRF tokens via Flask-WTF  
✅ **Data Isolation** - Users can only see and edit their own books  
✅ **Environment Variables** - Secret key stored in .env (not committed to git)  
✅ **Form Validation** - Email format and password confirmation validation  
✅ **Rate Limiting** - Login attempts limited to 5 per minute to prevent brute force; email changes limited to 10 per hour  
✅ **Security Logging** - All authentication events logged for audit trail  
✅ **Email Security** - Email display on signup prevents user lockout from typos; settings page allows secure email changes with password verification  
✅ **Accessibility** - WCAG AA/AAA color contrast standards for inclusive design (7:1+ contrast ratios)
