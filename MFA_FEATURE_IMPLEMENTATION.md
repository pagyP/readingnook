# Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) Feature Implementation

## Overview

The Reading Nook app now includes **optional Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** using Time-based One-Time Passwords (TOTP). Users can enable MFA to secure their accounts with an authenticator app (Google Authenticator, Authy, Microsoft Authenticator, etc.).

## Key Features

- ✅ **TOTP-based MFA**: Use authenticator apps for 6-digit codes
- ✅ **Device Trust**: Mark devices as "trusted" for 30 days to reduce MFA friction
- ✅ **Recovery Code Integration**: Use existing recovery codes to regain access if MFA app is lost
- ✅ **Encrypted TOTP Secrets**: Secrets are encrypted in the database using your password
- ✅ **Optional**: Users can choose to enable or disable MFA anytime
- ✅ **Zero Cookies**: Device trust uses stateless fingerprinting (User-Agent + IP hash)

## What's New

### Database Models
- **User Model** - Added MFA fields:
  - `mfa_enabled` (Boolean): Whether MFA is active
  - `mfa_secret_encrypted` (String): Encrypted TOTP secret
  - `mfa_last_authenticated` (DateTime): Last successful MFA verification

- **TrustedDevice Model** - New model for managing trusted devices:
  - Device fingerprinting (SHA256 hash of User-Agent + IP)
  - Optional user-provided device names
  - 30-day expiration with automatic cleanup
  - User can revoke devices anytime

### Forms
- **MFASetupForm**: TOTP code (6 digits) + password verification
- **MFAVerifyForm**: TOTP code OR recovery code + device trust checkbox

### Routes
- `GET/POST /mfa/setup` - Display QR code and enable MFA
- `POST /mfa/disable` - Disable MFA on account
- `GET /mfa/trusted-devices` - View and manage trusted devices
- `POST /mfa/trusted-devices/<id>/revoke` - Revoke individual device
- `Enhanced /login` - Support for TOTP/recovery code verification
- `Enhanced /settings` - Display MFA status and management options

### How It Works

#### Enabling MFA
1. User goes to Settings → Multi-Factor Authentication → Enable MFA
2. App generates a TOTP secret and displays a QR code
3. User scans QR code with authenticator app
4. User enters 6-digit code from app + their password to verify
5. MFA is enabled, user can view recovery codes

#### Logging In with MFA
1. User enters email + password
2. App checks if device is already trusted (skip MFA if yes)
3. If device not trusted:
   - User enters 6-digit code from authenticator app
   - OR enters a recovery code if they lost their app
   - Optional: Check "Trust this device for 30 days"
4. Login complete

#### Device Trust
- Fingerprint: SHA256 hash of (User-Agent + IP address)
- Expires after 30 days
- If IP changes on mobile/VPN, user will need to re-verify once
- Users can manually revoke devices from settings

#### Using Recovery Codes During MFA
- If user loses their authenticator app, they can enter a recovery code
- Recovery code immediately disables MFA
- User sees warning: "Recovery code used. MFA has been disabled. Please set up MFA again to secure your account."
- User must re-enable MFA after recovery

### Security Implementation

#### TOTP Secret Encryption
- Uses AES-128 in CBC mode with HMAC-SHA256 authentication (Fernet)
- Key derived from user's password using PBKDF2HMAC:
  - 480,000 iterations (OWASP recommended)
  - SHA256 hashing algorithm
- Even if database is compromised, attacker needs password to access TOTP secret

#### Password Protection
- MFA setup requires password verification
- Ensures only account owner can enable MFA
- MFA disable requires POST (prevents accidental clicks)

#### Rate Limiting
- `/mfa/setup`: 10 per hour
- `/mfa/disable`: 5 per hour
- `/login` with MFA: 5 per minute (existing limit)

#### Audit Logging
- All MFA actions logged (enable, disable, device trust, etc.)
- Tracks which user performed action and when

## Database Migration

### Fresh Database Setup (New Deployments)

For **new deployments with no existing data**:
- `db.create_all()` in `init_db.py` automatically creates the `user` table with MFA columns
- `TrustedDevice` table is created automatically
- No manual steps needed

### Existing Database Setup (Migration Required)

⚠️ **Important**: `db.create_all()` **only creates tables that don't exist**. It **does NOT alter existing tables** to add new columns.

For **existing deployments with data**, you **MUST** manually add the MFA columns using one of these approaches:

#### Option 1: Zero-Downtime Migration (Recommended for Production)

Add the columns to the existing PostgreSQL database without losing data or downtime:

```bash
docker exec readingnook_db psql -U readingnook -d readingnook -c "
ALTER TABLE \"user\" ADD COLUMN mfa_enabled BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE;
ALTER TABLE \"user\" ADD COLUMN mfa_secret_encrypted VARCHAR(255);
ALTER TABLE \"user\" ADD COLUMN mfa_last_authenticated TIMESTAMP;
"
```

Then create the `trusted_device` table:

```bash
docker exec readingnook_db psql -U readingnook -d readingnook << 'EOF'
CREATE TABLE trusted_device (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES "user"(id),
    device_fingerprint VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    device_name VARCHAR(255),
    user_agent VARCHAR(500),
    ip_address VARCHAR(45),
    expires_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    last_used_at TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE INDEX idx_user_fingerprint ON trusted_device(user_id, device_fingerprint);
EOF
```

#### Option 2: Clean Restart (if downtime is acceptable)

If you prefer a fresh start without data:

```bash
docker compose down -v
docker compose up
```

This removes the old database and creates a new one with correct schema. **All previous data will be lost.** Only use this if you don't need to preserve existing user accounts or book data.

### Error If Migration Not Done

If you don't run the migration, the app will fail with:

```
psycopg.errors.UndefinedColumn: column "user".mfa_enabled does not exist
```

This error occurs when users try to log in, as the login route attempts to access `user.mfa_enabled`.

## Testing MFA Locally

### Prerequisites
- Fresh Docker container (or migrated database)
- Authenticator app installed (Google Authenticator, Authy, etc.)

### Steps

1. **Register a new account**
   - Go to http://localhost:5000/register
   - Create user with email and password
   - Save recovery codes

2. **Enable MFA**
   - Log in to your account
   - Go to Settings
   - Click "Enable MFA"
   - Scan QR code with authenticator app
   - Enter 6-digit code from app + your password
   - Verify and save settings

3. **Test MFA on Login**
   - Log out
   - Log in with email + password
   - Should see MFA verification prompt
   - Enter 6-digit code from authenticator
   - Option to trust device
   - Should log in successfully

4. **Test Device Trust**
   - Log out again
   - Log in with same email + password
   - Should skip MFA (device is trusted for 30 days)
   - Verify in Settings → Trusted Devices

5. **Test Recovery Code**
   - Go to Settings → MFA Management
   - Click "Revoke All Devices" or manually revoke from device list
   - Log out
   - Log in with email + password
   - Use recovery code instead of TOTP
   - Should log in and see warning about MFA disabled
   - MFA should be disabled in Settings

6. **Disable MFA**
   - Go to Settings → MFA Management
   - Click "Disable MFA"
   - Confirm
   - Future logins won't require MFA

## Architecture Notes

### Why No Cookies for Device Trust?

This implementation avoids browser cookies entirely:
- Device fingerprint is calculated fresh on each login
- Stateless design works with load-balanced deployments
- No session management complexity
- Trade-off: IP changes will reset trust (acceptable for personal app)

### Why Encrypt TOTP Secrets?

- Database could be compromised via SQL injection
- Password hash alone isn't enough for TOTP decryption
- Using plaintext password + PBKDF2HMAC provides strong encryption
- Key derivation ensures same password always derives same key
- Prevents TOTP bypass even if both password and TOTP secret are stolen

### Recovery Code Design

- Reuses existing recovery codes (no duplicate system)
- Using recovery code disables MFA (prevents account lockout)
- Users must re-enable MFA after recovery
- Encourages security-conscious behavior

## Known Limitations

- IP-based device fingerprinting: Users on mobile/VPN may see IP changes and lose device trust
- TOTP requires manual entry: No push notification or one-click verification
- Recovery codes are one-time use: After using one, it's consumed

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Push-based MFA (e.g., Duo Security)
- [ ] SMS fallback for TOTP
- [ ] WebAuthn/FIDO2 support
- [ ] Backup codes regeneration
- [ ] Trusted device duration customization
